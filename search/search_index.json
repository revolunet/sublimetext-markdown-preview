From now on, files should auto-reload when you open them in the browser unless you disable \nSimple Reload\n.\n\n\nPreview Path Conversion\n\ue157\n\n\nIn the generated previews, paths are converted so that images and other links work properly. By default, paths are converted to absolute paths, but you can use relative if desired as well.  Image paths can also be changed to inject embedded base 64 images (only for local images). Path handling is controlled by the following two settings:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Sets how image paths are handled.\n\n\n        Setting is a string value: (absolute | relative | base64 | none)\n\n\n            absolute: converts relative local paths to absolute\n\n\n            relative: converts relative local paths to a path relative to the\n\n\n                        HTML output\n\n\n            base64: coverts the local file to base64 and embeds it in the HTML\n\n\n            none: does nothing\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"image_path_conversion\"\n:\n \n\"absolute\"\n,\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Sets how file paths are handled.\n\n\n        Setting is a string value: (absolute | relative | none)\n\n\n            absolute: converts relative local paths to absolute\n\n\n            relative: converts relative local paths to a path relative to the\n\n\n                        HTML output\n\n\n            none: does nothing\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"file_path_conversions\"\n:\n \n\"absolute\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview Temp Location\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default, previews are generated in the OSs default temp location, but you can specify your own custom temp location via the \npath_tempfile\n option:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Sets a custom temporary folder for MarkdownPreview-generated HTML files. Useful if you're\n\n\n        using LiveReload and don't want to use the OS default. The directory will be created if it\n\n\n        doesn't exist. Relative paths are supported, and are checked against `os.path.isabs`, see\n\n\n        doc: http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isabs\n\n\n\n        Examples: /tmp/custom_folder   (Linux/OSX - absolute path)\n\n\n                    C:/TEMP/MYNOTES\n\n\n                    C:\\\\TEMP\\\\MYNOTES    (Windows - absolute path, forward slash or escaped back slash)\n\n\n                    build                (All OS - relative path, current dir)\n\n\n                    ../build             (Linux/OSX - relative path, in parent dir)\n\n\n                    ..\\\\build            (Windows - relative path, in parent dir)\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"path_tempfile\"\n:\n \n\"/tmp/my_notes\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Other External Markdown Parsers\n\ue157\n\n\nExternal parser commands and arguments should first be mapped to a name.  Each binary value must be an array with the path to the binary being first, followed by flags and options as individual indexes in the array.\n\n\n    \n\"markdown_binary_map\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"multimarkdown\"\n:\n \n[\n\"/usr/local/bin/multimarkdown\"\n,\n \n\"--some-option\"\n,\n \n\"some-value\"\n]\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the name can be placed in \nenabled_parsers\n to enable use of the new parser.\n\n\n    \n\"enabled_parsers\"\n:\n \n[\n\"markdown\"\n,\n \n\"github\"\n,\n \n\"multimarkdown\"\n],\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Python Markdown Extensions\n\ue157\n\n\nPython Markdown comes with a number of extensions and can also use a number of 3\nrd\n party extensions.  To configure Markdown Preview with extensions, use the \nmarkdown_extensions\n setting.\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n is a setting that contains an array of extensions in the format of their import path. For instance, the Toc (Table of Contents) extension is found in the Markdown Package at \nmarkdown.extensions.toc\n.  This is according to Python Markdown \ndocumentation\n.  All extensions must be specified this way.\n\n\n    \n\"markdown_extensions\"\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n\"markdown.extensions.toc\"\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo configure an extension, make the entry a dictionary.  In this example, we want to turn on Toc's permalink feature:\n\n\n    \n\"markdown_extensions\"\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"markdown.extensions.toc\"\n:\n \n{\n\n                \n\"permalink\"\n:\n \ntrue\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure extension options with strings, booleans, integers, floats, etc.  But sometimes, an extension can take a function.  Functions are not part of the JSON spec. Luckily, support has been added with the following syntax:\n\n\nTo specify a function, create an object whose key is named \n!!python/name\n, and whose value is the import path of the function.  This syntax was picked to be similar to PyYaml's syntax which is used for the Markdown frontmatter.\n\n\nSo let's pretend we didn't like Toc's default slugify \nmarkdown.extensions.headerid.slugify\n, and instead wanted to use PyMdown Extensions' slugify \npymdownx.slugs.uslugify\n.  We could specify the new slugify function with the following syntax:\n\n\n    \n\"markdown_extensions\"\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"markdown.extensions.toc\"\n:\n \n{\n\n                \n\"slugify\"\n:\n \n{\n\"!!python/name\"\n,\n \n\"pymdownx.slugs.uslugify\"\n}\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare to the PyYaml format:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n  - markdown.extensions.toc:\n      slugify: !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify\n\n\n\n\nTo build\n\ue157\n\n\nJust use \nctrl\n+\nB\n (Windows/Linux) or \ncmd\n+\nB\n (Mac) to build current file.\n\n\nYou can configure the build action by using the \nbuild_action\n setting.\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        By default, Markdown Preview builds the HTML in the source directory.\n\n\n        It expects the file to exist on disk.  It pops up the build output panel etc.\n\n\n\n        If you wish to override this behavior, you can change \"build_action\"\n\n\n\n        build - The default build behavior.\n\n\n        browser - Preview the file in your browser.\n\n\n        clipboard - Copy the HTML output to the clipboard.\n\n\n        sublime - Export the HTML to a Sublime tab.\n\n\n        save - Run the normal save command that outputs to the source directory.\n\n\n            It will also prompt for \"save as\" if the file does not exit on disk.\n\n\n\n        All the build options use the default parser defined above in \"parser\"\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"build_action\"\n:\n \n\"build\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the parser that is used when building is set in the \nparser\n setting:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Sets the parser used for building markdown to HTML.\n\n\n\n        NOTE: The parser setting is not for the preview commands now.\n\n\n        The previews have separate commands for each parser markdown.\n\n\n\n        Warning for github API: if you have a ST2 linux build, Python is not built with SSL so it may not work\n\n\n\n        default - The current default parser is python-markdown parser.\n\n\n        markdown - Use the built-in python-markdown parser\n\n\n        github - Use the github API to convert markdown, so you can use GitHub flavored Markdown, see https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"parser\"\n:\n \n\"markdown\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen building, a panel will be opened showing build information.

Normally, we just inject CSS generated by Pygments which is the default behavior. Whether the CSS injection occurs, the Pygments' style that is used, and the CSS class that is used for code blocks can all be controlled with the following options:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        If Pygments is being used, you may want to inject one of the Pygment styles provided into the HTML.\n\n\n        If so, enable this.\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"pygments_inject_css\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Name of the Pygments style to inject.

Markdown Preview can actually handle them in a couple of ways: online and offline.\n\n\nOnline\n\ue157\n\n\nParsing GFM using the online method requires using the Github API as the parser.  It may also require setting \ngithub_mode\n to \ngfm\n to get things like tasklists to render properly.\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Default mode for the github Markdown parser : markdown (documents) or gfm (comments)\n\n\n        see http://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/#render-an-arbitrary-markdown-document\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"github_mode\"\n:\n \n\"markdown\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the GitHub API without an oauth key is limited to so many calls.  After the limit is reached, the GitHub API will deny further calls until after a set limit of time. To avoid this issue, you can set your API key in the settings as follows:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Uses an OAuth token when parsing markdown with GitHub API. To create one for Markdown Preview, see https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-oauth-token-for-command-line-use.\n\n\n        Warn: this secret *must not be shared* with anyone and at least you should create it with minimal scopes for security reasons.\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"github_oauth_token\"\n:\n \n\"secret\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GitHub API only inserts IDs for headers when \ngithub_mode\n is \nmarkdown\n, but it doesn't quite generate the way that GitHub does in your project's readmes on the site. This makes it so the GitHub CSS doesn't create the clickable anchors. So when \ngithub_mode\n is \nmarkdown\n, you can have Markdown Preview insert the ids properly so the CSS works with the following option:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Enables a post process to inject header ids to ensure hrefs to headers work\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"github_inject_header_ids\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nOffline\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default almost all extensions are enabled to help with a GitHub-ish feel, but there are some tweaks needed to get the full experience.\n\n\nGFM does not auto guess language in fenced blocks, but Markdown Preview does this by default.  You can fix this in one of two ways:\n\n\n\n\nDisable auto language guessing in the settings file \n\"guess_language\": false,\n\n\n\n\nOr if you are manually defining extensions:\n\n\n\"markdown_extensions\"\n:\n \n[\n\n    \n\"codehilite\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"guess_lang\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n        \n\"pygments_style\"\n:\n \n\"github\"\n\n    \n}\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a number of extensions are included by default. You can remove ones that are not part of GFM.\n\n\nIncluding CSS\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default Markdown Preview includes a default CSS via the \ncss\n setting.  It uses the special keyword \ndefault\n to represent the default CSS.\n\n\n    \n\"css\"\n:\n \n[\n\"default\"\n],\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can include whatever CSS you want, and even remove the \ndefault\n if you like.  It can take URLs or file paths. If you want to add a resource that is contained within a Sublime Package (like the Markdown Preview package itself), you can use the special URL of \nres://<package_name>/<subfolders>/file.css\n. Using the \nres://\n format will allow Markdown Preview to resolve the resource when it is in a package that is zipped and unzipped.\n\n\nOverride CSS by File Type\n\ue157\n\n\nYou can also override the default CSS with special file specific CSS. This CSS does not replace the default, but will append CSS for a supported file type after the conventional CSS.\n\n\nSo assuming the following configuration:\n\n\n    \n\"css\"\n:\n \n[\n\"default\"\n],\n\n    \n// File must be of one type below\n\n    \n\"markdown_filetypes\"\n:\n \n[\n\".md\"\n,\n \n\".markdown\"\n,\n \n\".mdown\"\n],\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could enable the following:\n\n\n    \n\"allow_css_overrides\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nThen if we have a file \nfilename.md\n and a CSS in the same directory \nfilename.css\n, that CSS will be applied to that file.\n\n\nIncluding HTML HEAD\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default, the head is always included in the HTML output. This includes the CSS, JavaScript, etc. If for some reason you need to omit the HEAD, you can by modifying the \ninclude_head\n option.  Just remove the target that you wish to omit the head in. The option \nbuild\n specifically refers to when \nbuild_action\n is set to \nbuild\n in the settings.\n\n\n    \n/* do we include the CSS when outputting HTML? */\n\n    \n\"include_head\"\n:\n \n[\n\"build\"\n,\n \n\"browser\"\n,\n \n\"sublime\"\n,\n \n\"clipboard\"\n,\n \n\"save\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding JavaScript\n\ue157\n\n\nJavaScript files can be included via the \njs\n setting.  It is a list and can take file paths or URLs. If you want to add a resource that is contained within a Sublime Package (like the Markdown Preview package itself), you can use the special URL of \nres://<package_name>/<subfolders>/file.js\n. Using the \nres://\n format will allow Markdown Preview to resolve the resource when it is in a package that is zipped and unzipped.\n\n\n    \n\"js\"\n:\n \n[],\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticMarkup\n\ue157\n\n\nPython Markdown can strip/apply out \nCriticMarkup\n syntax if desired.  Simply enable the following option:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Sets how multimarkdown critic marks are handled.\n\n\n        Setting is a string value: (accept | reject | none)\n\n\n            accept: Accepts the proposed inserts and deletions (comments etc. are discarded)\n\n\n            reject: Rejects the proposed inserts and deletions (comments etc. are discarded)\n\n\n            none: does nothing\n\n\n\n        Critic marks only affects \"github\" and \"markdown\" (Python Markdown).\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"strip_critic_marks\"\n:\n \n\"none\"\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple HTML Output\n\ue157\n\n\nSome people may desire a stripped down output on occasions that does not include HTML headers, inline styles, and IDs. Markdown Preview has a mode that will strip out these things and omit using a template.  This mode can be enabled via the the \nhtml_simple\n option:\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n        Sets HTML output to a simple form:\n\n\n            - No head\n\n\n            - No body tags\n\n\n            - ids, classes, and style are stripped out\n\n\n            - Just bare minimum HTML tags and attributes\n\n\n            - extension modifications included\n\n\n    */\n\n    \n\"html_simple\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,",

To configure Markdown Preview with extensions, use the  markdown_extensions  setting.  markdown_extensions  is a setting that contains an array of extensions in the format of their import path. For instance, the Toc (Table of Contents) extension is found in the Markdown Package at  markdown.extensions.toc .  This is according to Python Markdown  documentation .  All extensions must be specified this way.       \"markdown_extensions\" :   [ \n         \"markdown.extensions.toc\" \n     ]   To configure an extension, make the entry a dictionary.  In this example, we want to turn on Toc's permalink feature:       \"markdown_extensions\" :   [ \n         { \n             \"markdown.extensions.toc\" :   { \n                 \"permalink\" :   true \n             } \n         } \n     ]   You can configure extension options with strings, booleans, integers, floats, etc.  But sometimes, an extension can take a function.  Functions are not part of the JSON spec. Luckily, support has been added with the following syntax:  To specify a function, create an object whose key is named  !!python/name , and whose value is the import path of the function.  This syntax was picked to be similar to PyYaml's syntax which is used for the Markdown frontmatter.  So let's pretend we didn't like Toc's default slugify  markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify , and instead wanted to use PyMdown Extensions' slugify  pymdownx.slugs.uslugify .  We could specify the new slugify function with the following syntax:       \"markdown_extensions\" :   [ \n         { \n             \"markdown.extensions.toc\" :   { \n                 \"slugify\" :   { \"!!python/name\" ,   \"pymdownx.slugs.uslugify\" } \n             } \n         } \n     ]   Compare to the PyYaml format:  markdown_extensions:\n  - markdown.extensions.toc:\n      slugify: !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify",
